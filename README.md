**Learn socket programming in C and write secure and optimized network code**

## What is this book about?
Network programming, a challenging topic in C, is made easy to understand with a careful exposition of socket programming APIs. This book gets you started with modern network programming in C and proper usage of the relevant operating system APIs.

This book covers the following exciting features:
- Creating TCP and UDP connections over IP 
- Resolve hostnames with DNS 
- Interface with online APIs over HTTP or HTTPS 
- Write safe and secure network code 
- Write high-performance server code

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you're a developer or a system administrator who wants to enter the world of network programming, this book is for you. Basic knowledge of C programming is assumed.

With the following softwares you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-14).

### Required Software

Following along with the code in this book requires that you to have access to a C compiler on a standard operating system. The example programs in this book were carefully tested on Windows, Linux, and macOS. They were tested using the gcc, clang, and Microsoft Visual Studio compilers. All of the code in this book will compile as either C or C++.

In addition, the code examples in Chapter 9, Loading Secure Web Pages with HTTPS and OpenSSL, and Chapter 10, Implementing a Secure Web Server, require that you have the OpenSSL library installed.

Chapter 11, Establishing SSH Connections with libssh, requires that the libssh library is installed.

Instructions for installing all of the require software are provided in the the appendices. See Appendix B, Setting Up Your C Compiler On Windows, Appendix C, Setting Up Your C Compiler On Linux, and Appendix D, Setting Up Your C Compiler On macOS, for compiler setup. A complete list of the example programs provided is given in Appendix E, Example Programs.

No non-free software is required to follow along with any of the examples in this book.

We also provide a PDF file that has color images of the screenshots/diagrams used in this book. [Click here to download it](http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/downloads/9781789349863_ColorImages.pdf).
